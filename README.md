# ipfw firewall scripts
## Remarks
Use `faulty.rules` and `good.rules` for testing purposes with `ipfw -n`.
NOTE: when using `.rules` files as argument for `ipfw` (script or command line) always use `/full/and/absolute/path/to/the.rules`.
## Vim ipfw rule syntax highlighting
Vim will reasonably highlight anything that ends in `.rules`.
